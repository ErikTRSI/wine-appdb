Wine AppDB
===

A modern re-write of the [Wine Project](http://winehq.org) [AppDB](http://appdb.winehq.org). 

Written in Ruby on Rails, it is an attempt to make it easier for users and visitors to determine how well an application works with Wine, and if there are complications, how to best deal with them.
